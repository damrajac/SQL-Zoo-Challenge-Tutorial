# SQL Zoo Challenge Tutorial

Repository of SQL queries I have used to solve the challenges in SQL Zoo tutorials

Some advice:

- Try to solve the challenges on your own first. 

- If you get stuck first look up SQL tutorials on https://www.w3schools.com/sql/ or similar SQL tutorial websites. 

- If you are still stuck then check these solutions :)

-- In order for keywords XOR and LENGTH to work, you have to make sure that MySQL is swiched on 
-- in the settings - you'll find the settings icon in the top right corner of the SQL Zoo webpage.
